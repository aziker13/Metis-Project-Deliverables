After succesful data collection and cleaning, I was able to put together a pivot table in Tableau for all of the data for both red and white wines.  I used some 
basic wine guidelines to make connection between descriptors (body) and a measurement from the table (alcohol content).  Using these I was able to further break down 
the data and look at trends and values of various properites of wine given a descriptor. These descriptors are key for being able to filter through the wine data given user input

My next step is to use parameters and parameter actions to build an interactive visual that will allow users to filter wine by their desired characteristics until they are left with a few options 
for wine that fits their description.
