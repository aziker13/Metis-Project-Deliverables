## What Wine?

Chefs and restaurateurs know that the the right glass of wine can add tremendously to the quality of their customers’ dining experience. 
Picking the right glass of wine isn’t always straight forward, and the VAST majority of places do not employ a Sommelier. Looking to buy a 
bottle of wine for more than your entree without the confidence it will pair well and taste delicious may discourage customers from buying. 
“What Wine?” is a data driven solution that can help restaurants big and small get the most out of their wine list while giving customers confidence 
to spend more and complete their dining experience. It works using by taking the physio-chemical properties of wine in tandem with the customers 
preferences to deliver a match for their individual tastes and meal of choice.

Data for this initial analysis comes from a 2009 study done at the University of California Irvine, with 10 chemical properties detailed for
Thousands of wines both red and white.  An individual sample will include physio-chemical characteristics and the overall quality grade it was 
assigned at assessment. 

EDA will be done in Microsoft excel and visualization of findings will be done in Tableau.  

An MVP would provide the user with the highest rated wine on the list, and be able to sort wine by properties the user values.
