Abstract

The problem scoped for this project is one centered around restaurants and the fact that most patrons will look at the wine list and go for either the cheapest
or second cheapest option, in large part because they lack the knowledge or confidence to spend more and know what they are getting. The business impact of solving 
this issue using data science would be restaurants seeing more money spent per meal, patrons having a better overall dining experience. This can be done using data driven 
wine recommendations. The dataset used to prove this concept was taken from UCI and contains physiochemical information on over 5000 different Vinho Verde wines.
Initial EDA was done in Microsoft excel and then further EDA plus visualization was done in Tableau.  The results were that key characteristics of wine such as body, 
acidity, and sweetness were quantifiable by the data, and thus wine could be filtered by the users preferences and sorted by the wine’s quality as determined by wine 
tasting experts.  In further development of this solution, having wine prices integrated into this interface would allow users to have the extra parameter of value

Design

The dining experience is not all about the food, and restaurants and patrons alike know that a good glass of wine can make the meal. Often times people choose not to order
wine or only order the least expensive bottle because of a lack of knowledge or confidence in what they choose. “What Wine?” is a data driven solution for restaurants and 
customers alike, that combines user input and recommendation modelling that gets more accurate over time to help guide restaurant goers to the right wine on the menu.
The potential impact of this solution will help restaurants get more bottles of wine sold, increase income, and give diners a better dining experience. 
In addition to the experience, diners can also build their taste profile, and try new wines with confidence that it will be something that they will enjoy.  

Data

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle as two separate .csv files, one containing red wine data and the other containing white wine data. 
The original data was part of a study done by the University of California Irvine, which was found at the following address:

Algorithms and tools

Cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, and visualization was done in a combination of Microsoft Excel and Tableau.

Communication

The slides that are presented contain relevant visualization of data and conclusions drawn from that data
