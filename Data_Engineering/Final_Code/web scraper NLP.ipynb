       " \"These guys deserve five stars and here's why. First off this is a review not of a drink, barista or cafe. I ordered five pounds of lighthouse and I was excited to try it out. Now, Lighthouse roasts darker than most third wave roasters and frankly I didn't know this. I was in the mood to try something new and I had heard good things so I decided to give them a shot. (No pun intended). When I opened the bag the beans were surprisingly dark with visible oils. I was instantly disappointed because I prefer a lighter roasted coffee. Again, nothing against Lighthouse as their roasting style is probably right up the alley of most coffee drinkers. I reached out to them by email and within a day or so they had refunded my purchase and sent me a pound of a different coffee to try. This is the ultimate in customer service. I was frankly taken aback. Even if their roasting style isn't my preference doesn't mean you won't love it so please give them a try. They are local, small and have the customer service game nailed.\",\n",
       " \"Picked up a bag of original and their featured blend yesterday as well and it's very good!The original has a very smooth finish and is super light unlike some of the ones were used too! I really loved how Le Coin which right down the cross promoted Lighthouse! Love seeing local businesses support one another! Especially during these times. I didn't find it very strong in the French press style. However I've had their drip before (first Seattle roaster I ever tried actually). And it's very good. So after brunch I popped up the hill to snag a couple of bags for the delonghi espresso I have at home. Had a cup this morning and it was very good! Grab a bag if you're in the area\",\n",
       " \"1000% would recommend this place. I got a latte and and iced latte, both were so delicious and everything I would want out of a latte. The staff was friendly, the service was prompt and there's a cute little outdoor seating area.\",\n",
       " 'I had their Mocha was too good! Not too sweet and not too strong. Perfect blend of coffee and chocolate. I am looking forward to buying coffee beans from them and will recommend this store to my friends',\n",
       " 'Strong, delicious coffee. Amazing outdoor seating. Nothing but five stars! Love that Lighthouse Roasters is in a cute residential neighborhood and that their roasting equipment is onsite. I sat outside with a magazine and my coffee while waiting for the bus...great spot to people watch, sit back and take in your surroundings.',\n",
       " \"Exceptional coffee. I've lived in Seattle for over twenty years and you would think that one could find really good coffee here. Not necessarily. Lighthouse is the exception. Great service and well made coffee. To test them, I purchased whole beans decaf. The beans were fresh, smooth, and delicious. If they can hit it out of the park on decaf they deserve more than five stars!\",\n",
       " \"This is the best coffee shop/roaster in Seattle. Unlike Lighthouse's neighbors, Cafe Vita and Vif, their cold brew doesn't give you borderline cardiac arrest. At the same time, it doesn't lose its classic Lighthouse flavor. Smooth with every sip. No headaches.I am a drip coffee guy. Not one for an americano or espresso shot. But that changes at Lighthouse. Their espresso is elite, far superior from the rest. Excellent, knowledgeable staff. Worth the drive from anywhere in Seattle.\",\n",
       " 'Great coffee at reasonable price! Covid-friendly pick up window available at the corner, drop in to get some coffee :) I loved their cold brew',\n",
       " 'The shop is homey and has a very friendly vibe. They roast their own beans. Good pastries too! The little patio is lovely in any weather.']"

       "[\"This café's been around for quite some time and you can literally feel the love that goes into their coffee. Lighthouse understands the craft. I've gotten their lattes (both iced and hot) and both were amazing with well-rounded espresso. If you can, bring your dog! They have dog biscuits at the ready :)\",\n",
       " \"These guys deserve five stars and here's why. First off this is a review not of a drink, barista or cafe. I ordered five pounds of lighthouse and I was excited to try it out. Now, Lighthouse roasts darker than most third wave roasters and frankly I didn't know this. I was in the mood to try something new and I had heard good things so I decided to give them a shot. (No pun intended). When I opened the bag the beans were surprisingly dark with visible oils. I was instantly disappointed because I prefer a lighter roasted coffee. Again, nothing against Lighthouse as their roasting style is probably right up the alley of most coffee drinkers. I reached out to them by email and within a day or so they had refunded my purchase and sent me a pound of a different coffee to try. This is the ultimate in customer service. I was frankly taken aback. Even if their roasting style isn't my preference doesn't mean you won't love it so please give them a try. They are local, small and have the customer service game nailed.\",\n",
       " 'Lighthouse is simply the best. My roommates and I come here multiple times a week for coffee and baked goods. They are also super dog friendly and have an adorable outdoor seating area! They will give your pup a treat with your permission.',\n",
       " \"Picked up a bag of original and their featured blend yesterday as well and it's very good!The original has a very smooth finish and is super light unlike some of the ones were used too! I really loved how Le Coin which right down the cross promoted Lighthouse! Love seeing local businesses support one another! Especially during these times. I didn't find it very strong in the French press style. However I've had their drip before (first Seattle roaster I ever tried actually). And it's very good. So after brunch I popped up the hill to snag a couple of bags for the delonghi espresso I have at home. Had a cup this morning and it was very good! Grab a bag if you're in the area\",\n",
       " \"1000% would recommend this place. I got a latte and and iced latte, both were so delicious and everything I would want out of a latte. The staff was friendly, the service was prompt and there's a cute little outdoor seating area.\",\n",
       " 'Strong, delicious coffee. Amazing outdoor seating. Nothing but five stars! Love that Lighthouse Roasters is in a cute residential neighborhood and that their roasting equipment is onsite. I sat outside with a magazine and my coffee while waiting for the bus...great spot to people watch, sit back and take in your surroundings.',\n",
       " 'I had their Mocha was too good! Not too sweet and not too strong. Perfect blend of coffee and chocolate. I am looking forward to buying coffee beans from them and will recommend this store to my friends',\n",
       " \"Exceptional coffee. I've lived in Seattle for over twenty years and you would think that one could find really good coffee here. Not necessarily. Lighthouse is the exception. Great service and well made coffee. To test them, I purchased whole beans decaf. The beans were fresh, smooth, and delicious. If they can hit it out of the park on decaf they deserve more than five stars!\",\n",
       " \"This is the best coffee shop/roaster in Seattle. Unlike Lighthouse's neighbors, Cafe Vita and Vif, their cold brew doesn't give you borderline cardiac arrest. At the same time, it doesn't lose its classic Lighthouse flavor. Smooth with every sip. No headaches.I am a drip coffee guy. Not one for an americano or espresso shot. But that changes at Lighthouse. Their espresso is elite, far superior from the rest. Excellent, knowledgeable staff. Worth the drive from anywhere in Seattle.\",\n",
       " 'Great coffee at reasonable price! Covid-friendly pick up window available at the corner, drop in to get some coffee :) I loved their cold brew',\n",
       " 'The shop is homey and has a very friendly vibe. They roast their own beans. Good pastries too! The little patio is lovely in any weather.',\n",
       " \"Lighthouse is, in many ways, the perfect classic Seattle coffeeshop. They roast in-house and sell and brew some of the best beans in the city. There's no wifi, so you have to hang out and read a book or newspaper, or talk to someone in the interesting crowd of regulars. Typically they have some delicious baked goods including cardamom cake and lemon glazed scones. However lately there seems to have been an interruption in this supply and they are offering more basic grocery store muffins. As a possible working location, it could be very good so long as you don't need wifi. I often find that I am more focused when working without internet access. If you really did need it you could hot spot or use your own internet of some variety. Currently, you can't sit inside, but rather order at the front door. There is a great outdoor area next-door for you to be able to sit outside on rocks or tables.\",\n",
       " 'Over roasted yirgicheffe coffee was sold to me. I am a first time online customer purchasing three of the ethiopian varieties. The yirgicheffe, the ethiopian blend and the mocca java. These are supposed to be a fruit forward coffee, more acidity, it should be a light roast. The yirgicheffe beans I actually received were over roasted, with that tell tale glossy oil sheen. They did not taste as a yirgicheffe should. I am very upset.Order number SNIP-17452.',\n",

       " 'Cute coffee shop that I only visited during Covid for the first time after moving to the area. There is always a line of at least 3 people, rain or shine, speaking to how popular this place is. Their lattes are really excellent and the texture of the foam is perfect. I love the donuts that they stock as well... Definitely a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. Love their roasted beans!',\n",

       " 'The best. I got hooked when I used to live down the street a million years ago. With all of the coffee in my new area, I still feel the need to journey out for this espresso when I can. I have also been known to make an excuse to go if I am anywhere close. Always hits the spot and a pleasant experience.',\n",
       " \"I love coffee and I'm fairly snobby about it. Like a lot of snobs, I brew pour-over at home. I found Lighthouse early last summer, and since then, these are the only beans I want to use for brewing! I like florals in my coffee, so I always get the Ethiopia beans. They're beautiful. I also love to make pour-overs for my coffee snob friends when they come over, and snobs are snobs, they know what they like. I often don't like that much what my friends make for me. But with the Lighthouse Ethiopia beans, I get complimented every time.Lighthouse is buried in a neighborhood, so it doesn't usually get that crowded. It's a straightforward place--great beans, great coffee, no frills. Go here. Then go here again and again and again.\",\n",

       " 'HANDS DOWN THE BEST COFFEE IN THE WORLD!!!!!But please do not visit the amazing old school Seattle coffee house if you are an ...uckster, you all seem to destroy everything that is a part of the old Seattle I love and miss so much. But if you want to support a Seattle original, love this place until you cannot snuggle monster it anymore. It is everything good, the coffee, the people, the owners and the most amazing outdoor bench (I miss the old bench, tear) in fremont and of course the creme on my americano is like a bitter sip of heaven every time',\n",
       " \"Tl;Dr awesome low key spot to get some delicious coffeeThis place is super chill, they don't have WiFi in order to facilitate face to face interactions which I think is awesome. Definitely a very chill and intimate environment. I can't say I'm the most discerning coffee drinker but I enjoyed their latte. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet and focused more of the flavor of the coffee. The art on top was a great touch! My friend got an iced caramel latte which had a nice caramel flavor that I enjoyed.\",\n",

       " \"Didn't expect it but, Lighthouse Roasters was fabulous. The prices are great for the city. Each and every single menu item that we purchased was extremely fresh and tasty. Workers are super friendly and service is really quick. We felt very welcomed at Lighthouse Roasters.\",\n",
       " 'I lived in this neighborhood for 2 1/2 years and Lighthouse has been an absolute staple. The staff are friendly and kind, and they make sure to get your order right. Their baked goods and coffee are delicious, and the outdoor seating in the summer is secluded and quiet for a getaway from the city. Fremont is so much better with this place in it!',\n",
       " 'Ok it\\'s official. I am officially making lighthouse coffee roasters my \"Best Bean\" in Seattle! I\\'ve been coming here for a couple years now and don\\'t do this lightly. Their beans are lush, rich, and \"roasty\". Whether you like espresso or pour overs or something fancy, you cannot go wrong with this coffee. I have to ride my bike up hill all the way to this place but it\\'s so worth it! If you know how much I hate going up hill you\\'d know how much I mean it!',\n",
       " 'This is a cute quaint little coffee shop tucked away off the main streets with a nice neighborhood feel. There\\'s a small seating area to the side of it to enjoy your coffee outside if the weather is nice. The gal at the counter was pleasant. My low rating is purely based on my flavor preferences in coffee- lighthouse ONLY offers dark roast beans, and their espresso is only ever the \"roasters choice\" (which is the name of the roast, not the actual random choice of the person roasting) they do offer multiple blends of beans, which I did not sample, but are all dark/Italian roast. They could be good, and if you are a dark roast fan then this place could be your jam, but I personally did not care for their flavor profile.',\n",
       " \"I didn't hear about this company until I was at a local Seattle restaurant for brunch and ordered the French press coffee. The coffee was so delicious and was a wonderful surprise-the server told me it where to find it and off I went. The coffee shop sits slightly above the downtown Fremont area and parking is hit or miss. Loved the coffee, not so much the staff. The older gentleman behind the counter seemed irritated being there and wasnt very helpful with our questions. Nonetheless, coffee was my priority and I got what I needed. Minimal seating options with limited options for food.\",\n",
       " \"One of the best shots in Seattle that not enough people know about, I think because they only have this single location. Good dark crema short shot.And, I've been using their French Roast beans for years for my french press at home. I've tried many beans around the city, this is the most reliable one\",\n",

       " 'Lighthouse Roasters Coffee is what I crave and dream of more than anything else, since I moved to Austin, TX from Seattle 8 years ago. I travel back to Seattle once per year, and make a stop every time for a cup and a bag of beans to take back to TX. Sad when I run out, I now order whole beans to be shipped. Down here in Texas, it\\'s my little piece of PNW heaven in a cup! Customer service is absolutely impeccable, and coffee is high quality, roasted with love you can taste in every cup. Their \"Roaster\\'s Choice\" and French Roast are my favorites. Thank you Lighthouse Roasters for making such delicious coffee with love and kindness!',\n",

       " \"I don't know how we found these guys, but I'm sure glad we did. We love their Mocha Java blend and have been drinking it regularly for months now. Their prices are reasonable and the staff is super friendly. While we haven't tried them, it looks like they also have an interesting selection of teas. Definitely a good coffee shop to check out.\",\n",
       " \"I first tried Lighthouse when I went to brunch at Tilikum Cafe. I would always order a pot of coffee and finally one day I asked them what their coffee was. Ever since then, I've been trying to find time to check out Lighthouse and today I finally made it!Today I got the cappuccino with the Roaster's Choice blend and it's superb. Wow! I also tried my boyfriend's macchiato with caramel and hot damn it's a must-have too!\",\n",

       " \"Fabulous coffee. However the biggest thing that is keeping it from 4 or 5 stars is the decor. This place isn't super cute or appealing to the eye (drab is the word that comes to mind but I feel harsh saying it). My wife loved her coffee but wasn't keen on sticking around for a while. However, if I was just getting coffee or had no focus on the decor then this would be my place to get good coffee.\",\n",
       " 'Lighthouse is a must-visit coffee shop for all Seattle coffee enthusiasts since this establishment roasts their own coffee in a quaint old corner building tucked off the beaten path up in Northern Fremont. While Lighthouse does offer top-notch coffee, this place does not tick off every box for the quintessential coffee shop experience, which is understandable considering the small size of this independent roaster. This location does have a cozy atmosphere, but there is unfortunately not quite enough seating so expect to get close to your fellow patrons. And even though the coffee is really good as stated, they, unfortunately, do not offer their coffee in pour-over format (only drip) and their macchiatos are served on their own with no accompanying soda water. This sounds snobby - and I admit it is - but I estimate that I have visited 200+ Seattle coffee shops at this point and I have grown to appreciate the finer details of my coffee experience.',\n",
       " 'Coffee is good - mellow and fresh. Pastries are yummy. I WANT to love this neighborhood coffee shop more than I do, but the service seems to me to be a little robotic. I get it - you have *lots* of customers, but a smile and a \"hi\" go a long way. Also, it\\'d be awesome if you ask me if I want a jacket for my extremely hot cup, because I\\'ll forget! And then I\\'ll be cussing to myself 15 seconds later as I walk home with a too-hot cup bouncing between hands. Thanks!',\n",
       " \"I'm a huge fan of the coffee at lighthouse, and they make my favorite americano in Seattle, hands-down. For this reason, I will always be back.The shop itself is no-frills in a good way. Very neighborhood-y. I also love to lounge on the bench with my dog or hang out in the outdoor alcove. I like the owner and the employees, they are never too busy to chat with you. Wonderful humans!The pastries and nibbles here could use an upgrade. Except for the tiny cupcakes, those are incredible! If they got some gourmet pastries in this coffeehouse, it would be a bonus, but the coffee is the point so I can't say that I care all that much...\",\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this little corner cafe in Fremont. It was a nice, interesting little place. Their selection of drinks is ok, but not all that great. To be honest, they could have a much better selection of cold beverages such as sodas, etc. for people that want to visit but are not necessarily coffee drinkers. The atmosphere was great. It definitely had that corner coffee shop feel to it, which was nice. They roast the coffee there on site with the big machine out where everyone can see it and how it's done. It is really cool and an awesome thing to see with all the bags of coffee piled up. I like that they roast their coffee on site. They could have had a larger selection of food options too. For a coffee shop, the selection was very slim and not really anything that was all that appeasing. Overall, great place and cool practices! Just needs more options on the menu for drinks and food, maybe some more cold options for drinks and warm options for food. I definitely recommend for a local chill out/ hang out spot, place to meet friends if your in the area or a quick caffeine fix pick me up. :)\",\n",

       " \"Honestly this place was very disappointing. Everything about it was bleh. I came to Seattle for my honeymoon and was trying out about 3 coffee shops a day and was in the area and saw this one had great reviews. I also really like the location and the building, it's really unique and fits in very well with the neighborhood. Below are the reasons why this deserves a 1 star:Inside: As soon as my wife and I stepped inside, it was as if our nostrils were smacked with a fish... The strangest part is that there was zero evidence of the presence of fish inside. I don't know what that was but it was not very pleasant and we were trying to get out of there sooner than we could. Very unappetizing for anywhere but a fish market.Service: The barista that took our order really needs to put a damn smile on his face and take some personality classes. He wasn't the most pleasant individual at all. Maybe it was the fish smell getting to him? Who knows. All I know is he was one of the worst baristas I have personally experienced. Not in the snobby hipster kind of way. Just the unfriendly, I don't really want to serve you but I have to, kind of attitude. It was the older gentleman with the multiple ear piercings. I don't mean to call you out but come on dude. If you aren't goingnto have a positive and friendly attitude behind the counter of a coffee shop, get a new gig.Coffee: Got a latte all week I was in Seattle and this one wasn't that great. Too harsh for my taste even with the steamed milk. So on top of the fishy smell and lame attitude barista, even the coffee failed me... Thanks for the free sticker I guess...\",\n",

My best days are quite honestly the rare one in which I was not loudly driven from bed by one of these wailing and willfully-neglected dogs.I respectfully addressed this reasonable complaint directly with the management & a dog owner and was given a totally disingenuous response (by both) with no resulting improvement of the situation afterwards. Based on the Lighthouse's lack of respect and consideration towards its neighbors, and the shamefully bold dismissal of my perfectly reasonable complaint, I cannot suggest supporting this business.If you are, or know these dog owners, please, leave the dog at home or address the barking.

I wrote down the Lighthouse Roasters name and I was finally able to check it out on a Friday after Thanksgiving. I called first to make sure they were open. Then I headed out to Fremont by bus and then walked through residential streets to get there. It was so chilly that day and I was really happy when I finally made it. Happy that I was in a warm interior, but disappointed as I expected to see a coffee shop and some retail setup where you can smell, touch and read about the coffee you are about to purchase. I remember going to Cafe Moto Roasters in San Diego which is located in a great industrial warehouse space with informative and passionate about coffee workers ready to give you tips and share their knowledge. This is not the case here: they only have a counter space where you can order coffee drinks and the coffee beans to purchase are showcased in a clear glass jars on the barista side. I was a little thrown off by that. Hopefully they mostly have it for display and don't sell these beans that are exposed to light and get to be sniffed around by people.  When I walked in there was only one person ahead of me and the barista was taking his sweet time chatting it up. I was a little in a hurry, but wanted to finally get their delicious tasting coffee and also some soy latte to go to warm me up. In the meantime about 4 or 5 new people came, but it was time to take my order. When I started asking about the coffee to purchase, the barista took down one of the big jars, but thought I would take forever, and he started taking order from the person behind me. I was really thrown off by that as I also wanted to order latte and now I would have to wait for him to finish his drink. I also walked really far and waited so long for this experience and this is not how this was going to happen. You can't always kill two birds with one stone. I just walked out. Possibly nobody meant to ignore me, they just got busy, but they should have the space organized better. For most of the time there was a woman behind the counter and she should have assisted some people. This place just makes no coffee love sense to me.\",\n",

Also, it seems like they have a lot of regulars - they knew people by name on more than one occasion and remembered their drinks as well.The interior is very nice and cozy with lots of nice places to sit, and the coffee was great- very smooth. Pick up some coffee beans here for home. Pastry selection was fresh and good.',\n",
       " \"Wonderful coffee shop with a great neighborhood feel. Their coffees have been a bit hit and miss for me. Sometimes really deep complex, roasty with hints of sweetness, other times just burnt and one-note. I think that they only really offer dark roasted coffees. While stalwarts of the dark roast have their place, the third wave of coffee has awakened customers' palates to other possibilities. I wish they would expand their offerings to some lighter roasts. Their banana bread rocks, though.\",\n",

       " \"Lighthouse was really quaint and a place I could see myself working from easily for 8 hours. The lower rating is for a couple of reasons. First, I ordered drip coffee and wasn't sure if they had any different roasts or if it was just one. There was also no explanation for which coffee was on that day, and the one I had was a bit nutty, which I wasn't a huge fan of but still thought it was good. Second, I picked up the cup and noticed grounds floating in it, which I thought was weird because drip is supposed to be filtered. When I went to throw away the cup, I noticed a solidified mass of grounds at the bottom of the cup and was nervous that I had been given instant coffee, which I would never buy anywhere. I really wanted to like Lighthouse, but this wasn't a glowing endorsement. I'll try it again in a few months. Maybe this was a fluke?\",\n",

Besides the indoor space, there are several outdoor options to enjoy your treats-- the bench for people watching the bus stop across the street (also VERY convenient for those catching a bus or getting off)-- the chairs on the rain-protected west side, and the garden-y rock wall with even more seating and tables at the top!

Located in a turn of the 20th century (still sounds weird to me) building on the corners of N 43rd St and Phinney Ave. N, it seemed the perfect recycling of an old mom & pop grocery store. Walking up to it, I could just picture an old Divco milk truck from the Sunshine dairy or a Langendorf bakery truck parked in front of it for deliveries.Inside, I saw a few patrons, some with children, and the now typical toppers (laptop wielding folks). The innards of the place have by no means been updated to look like a designer coffee shop. No, it looks more like they put a roasting company and coffee bar in a small Moose Lodge. The staff were very nice when I ordered my double 12oz latte.Now, when it comes to coffee, I\\'m an awful popular fella (sarcasm) with baristas. My latte, from the bottom to the top of a 12oz cup is as follows: 1/2 inch of foam on the bottom (yes, before the shots)Two 20 second short pull or restretto shots poured over itSteamed milk poured slowly to the top150 degrees final temperatureThat\\'s a \"Phil\". I think it better blends the milk and shots together to make it taste more full and creamy. Some baristas have actually tried it and now that\\'s how they drink theirs. Try it that way sometime, you see what I mean. I didn\\'t have Lighthouse make a Phil. When trying a new coffee place, I judge how good they are by how they make a regular latte at full strenght. If they are good at a regular, they\\'ll be good at a Phil. My first Lighthouse latte had wonderful flavor if you like a little coffee in your milk. What I could taste of the coffee was respectably good. Not Peet\\'s nutty/cocao\\'y good but still good. If you like your latte leaning on the mild side, that may be a perfect latte for you but I like a little kick. I like to savor the flavor of good coffee. I realize that a latte is only as good as the coffee and the barista making it so in all fairness, they get 3 and a hidden half a star and I will try them again but next time, I\\'ll ask them give the shots a few more seconds on the clock.*THIS JUST IN: I needed some quick calories and was in the neighborhood of Trophy Cupcakes. yelp.com/biz/Bb-j-Kq81pF… They serve Lighthouse coffee there and so I ordered a hummingbird cupcake and a double latte and now it\\'s official, Lighthouse is delightful coffee when made correctly and is now my second favorite coffee.',\n",

However, if you're planning on coming here to study, it might not be the best place because it's a little loud, since they have a huge roasting thing in the back.

Their prices are reasonable, especially compared to their neighboring competitors. And their staff is friendly, to regulars and newcomers alike.

That\\'s a 30% tax. $2.08 is still a reasonable price for espresso, yeah, but 30% tax? In what world do you live? Lest we forget Seattle is 9.5%. Other key fact, yeah, staff is not nice unless they deem you worthy. There is delay at every stage. Payment, when they actually start your drink and still more before you actually get your drink. They are always chatting with patrons who they like I guess, because their unspoken vibe is that everyone else can just go to hell. Coffee is good enough, prices are reasonable enough and if your personal shine is unaffected by the dark clouds that work there by all means go.

       " 'After a spending a beautiful sunny (and cold windy) day at the Zoo with the family we decided we wanted to warm up and take advantage of what Seattle has to offer before heading back to the East Side. Used my handy-dandy Yelp app and looks like Lighthouse Roasters is the place to be, there\\'s a Vita too, but I was in the mood for something different.Parking and Atmosphere: Anyway first off, parking in the neighborhood is meh, but gladly being a Sunday there wasn\\'t much traffic and parking nearby. Walking in, the atmosphere is really, well bleh. As others have said, the place feels more like it was made to be a Roaster and they serve coffee, versus being a coffee shop. There is seating, there is wifi, there are people hanging out. But yeah as others have said, it\\'s just not a comfy atmosphere, no music, the chairs are uncomfortable and wooden, most of the cups just don\\'t have that nice look/feel, and there isn\\'t much on the menu other than coffee. But since we were there for really a quick cup of coffee and possibly a bag of roast, I think it was fine. I was also able to find ONE kid\\'s book for my toddler. There is one plus for the atmosphere, which is the gigantic roaster. That my daughter kept pointing to and screaming \"TRAIN!!! Choo! Choo!!!\" mostly likely causing annoyance to those around me, but whatever It does indeed look like a train lol.The Coffee:  The wifey ordered a Mocha, I ordered a Cappuccino both in smalls. Oh and a chocolate milk for my daughter which the Barista happily made as a special order (much appreciated). Surprisingly there was not a size option for the Cappuccino, maybe due to lack of cup sizes? Anyway, both coffees were really good. Very flavorful coffee, and I really enjoyed the consistency of the foam for both. The coffee was so rich that despite both of us having a small, I was surprisingly very satisfied when I typically order larger sized coffees. Price: Fair, same as most other joints including the roasts which were about $14.50-$17/lb.Service:  The barista was friendly, I do appreciate that I did not get the unwelcome vibe when I brought in a toddler to this type of coffee joint, and he was more than happy to take the special order of a chocolate milk. The Roast:  I just had my roast this morning via pour over. 21 grams of the \"Roasters Choice\" with 360 grams of water. A very nice medium roast lacking the acidic taste you may get from other coffees and a little dryer. I enjoyed it very much and excited for when my wife gets home and we can share a Chemex this afternoon. Overall: Given I live in Bellevue, I probably will not be visiting that often, also given the atmosphere, not a place I\\'d hang out either. However, thank you for being inviting, the coffee was great. And I will definitely make this a stop whenever I visit the zoo for a bag of beans. Definitely worth a drop in if you want some great coffee and are in the area.Note: Someone brought in their dog with no issues. It was cute given the dog was very friendly and my daughter loved it. I can see how some people may have issues with non-service animals being allowed in a food establishment though.',\n",

The guy who roasts is a genuinely nice person, and will talk to you - or your out of town guests- while he is mixing beans or checking roast time. Lighthouse is all about the coffee - you'll find no mixed up goofy frapapapa whatever or pumpkin spice moomoo drinks here, nor is there any wireless (!) - which after a while I ended up liking because it makes you focus on the goodness of the coffee. There are displays of local art, and sweet kid & pet friendly seating with no sense of rush when enjoying your coffee and any conversation along the way. Go in the summer and sit outdoors in the lovely little stone garden on the side of the building, and watch the dog party congregate while their people go in for their morning libations. My only caveat: the drip is not so great - go for an Americano if you need your coffee watery...it's all about the pull here.

The drip coffee I'm drinking (yay! drip!) right now from Lighthouse tastes like coffee-flavored water instead (boo! drip!).What gives? Is coffee -- especially drip coffee -- really so hard to do? I know I can be picky, but there is a huge gulf of coffee between the boundaries of good, black-as-my-heart black coffee and the point where you need a tongue-scraper immediately after consuming the beverage!It is a neat place, if sometimes unsettlingly loud and impossible to find parking for.

Two items of caution: the chai is dang spicy, and the iced mochas leave much to be desired. Everything else is dee-licious.

I guess he was too awesomely hipster to let customers know their coffee was up.  When we finally asked him about where our coffee was he said that those on the counter were ours. So why did he put vanilla sweetener in it then (which we certainly did not want)? Who knows. Strike three for me was putting the coffees into thin glass cups? Have these people ever heard of the principles of insulation and radiation, whereby lack of insulation makes your hand burn while holding the coffee and allows the warmth of your coffee to rapidly dissipate? This is why people use coffee mugs so their coffee does not get cold fast (as ours did) and you don't burn your hand. So despite this how was the coffee?

I would observe many warm, friendly interactions between the staff and folks in line or waiting at the counter and then my own interactions and those of some others were stony and rather curt. Since I have family that lives just a couple of blocks from Lighthouse and are there daily I had heard that it is a really \"local\" café and I\\'d read many Yelp reviews where folks had encountered the cold experience of not being a regular. Once, I\\'d actually sat outside for maybe ten minutes contemplating the choice of Lighthouse or Café Vita just a couple of blocks away and finally went to Café Vita just because of the desire to have a friendly interaction with a barista. In the months since that day I have come back many times and I must say that my interactions with the staff haven\\'t really changed all that much...I guess I\\'ve just accepted it. I\\'m not saying the interactions are bad, they just lack any of the friendliness that one would expect at a tiny, local café and especially when one can observe those types of interactions taking place regularly. With all that said, I think it should be clear that there must be a reason to come here: their cappuccino is, at times, the best in Seattle. It\\'s not always the best, the lack of 100% consistency is what I expect from any great, local coffee shop. But never bad, always good or better. I\\'ve tried their espresso before and I don\\'t recommend it. Zoka makes the best shots in Seattle - perfect without any added ingredients. Lighthouse espresso is not so good on its own, but really shines in a cappuccino. The baristas at Lighthouse care about making good drinks - not as much as some of the folks at Zoka, but they do care. Also, Lighthouse prices are on the lower end of averages in Seattle so I find them one of the better values. Finally, as far as the \\'neighborhood feel\\' of various coffee shops in Seattle, I have to admit that Lighthouse might take first place or at least rank very highly. They have a location that screams \\'local\\' and views that I find serene or city-connected (watching the Metro buses go by every ten minutes or so).

I live right down the street and was so stoked to have a cool local coffee place to walk to. I went there on my way to work one morning, it was not crowded but looked comfortable and homey UNTIL I got to the counter to order my drink. The barista was totally pretentious (I felt weird ordering my normal double tall non fat vanilla latte... and when I did get the courage to finally place my order, he looked at me and said in a nasty tone \"you mean a small?\"... \"uhhh sure I replied\") Thank god I had cash on hand as they don\\'t accept cards if your order is under $5 - I don\\'t even want to know what kind of attitude I would have gotten if I didn\\'t...In addition to the bad attitude their coffee was not amazing AND they forgot my vanilla all three times I went there. I gave it 3 times... and I won\\'t be back.',\n",

       " \"This is the real deal for Seattle neighborhood coffee. Their beans are so good that many coffee shops just use their beans. But the atmosphere here is what you need to stop in for. I frequent this place and my other favorite (Herkimer's). A typical Saturday/Sunday morning here, locals may be huddled around a table jawing over a crossword puzzle, others just catching up. the place is always packed though never seems like much of a wait. And the coffee is up with the best (and that list does not include the lesser quality and highly commercialized better known brands).  I particularly like their Roaster's Choice if you want to bring some beans home with you.\",\n",
       " \"Lighthouse is not only the best coffee place in Fremont it's the best in Seattle. I have NEVER had a bad coffee drink there. Normally I go for a flavor-less latte or just a cup of drip because most coffee places these days follow the awful Starbucks practice of masking crappy coffee with a lot of even crappier syrup. In the mood for a vanilla latte I took a stroll down to Lighthouse with my man one afternoon. I was so pleasantly surprised by the flavor of their coffee! The shots are always perfectly pulled and their milk is steamed to perfection.They are unpretentious and focus on making really good coffee. I've read some slightly unfavorable reviews of their pastries but I've always really enjoyed the baked goods the sell. I would recommend the pear tartlet if they have it! In the same vein of making delicious lattes, their mochas are the yummiest in the world. 2 years ago, when I moved to Seattle, I had sworn off mochas. Every place I've ever ordered a mocha at served something that tasted like steamed chocolate milk with drip coffee. Yuck. At the behest of my man I finally ordered one Lighthouse. As I mentioned they let their coffee speak for itself whether it's shots in your drink or just a cup of drip. They needn't mask any burnt or bad tasting shots. I don't know what syrup they use but it's delicious and understated; mild but existant. I'm sad I don't know his name but my FAVORITE barista in Seattle works at Lighthouse-he is tall and skinny with long red hair. Have him make your drink!\",\n",

       " 'Awful service. I have lived in Fremont most of my life and have been passing by the place since it was a little grocery store on the corner. I finally went in to check it out, and the unfriendly servers behind the counter helped the woman in line behind us as we were trying to order and then placed our coffee on the cluttered counter without letting us know. I would recommend walking the extra 4 blocks to Vita or better yet, go to Ladro on 36th. I am definitely never going back.',\n",
       " \"Something about this place compelled me to stop, and boy am I glad I did, as I feel as though I've discovered a little, hidden treasure... They serve THE BEST Americanos here--I've never seen such beautiful crema on an Americano in my life! And, they are surprisingly--no refreshingly--inexpensive. I read a complaint that they are served in glasses, which is true some of time, but sometimes they serve it in a mug--and you can tell them which one you prefer--which is what I do. The prices on the wall are for single shots, which explains the discrepancy in the price--but who can complain about spending a little over 2 bucks for a high quality Americano with 2 shots, just because it is not delineated on the board? And, parking? Well, they are right smack in the middle of a neighborhood--the only parking is residential, but I've never had to park more than a block away (and it's free, at that). I guess there is a level of casualness in some of the details here, but that is part of what I love about this place (not something I appreciate everywhere) because there is something really relaxed about the vibe here that I am so in love with. It is welcoming, not trendy, but cool....and a culmination of things that just work for me (the greatest being their Americano)...and, again, I am so glad I just happened by it one day, as it could have easily been missed if I hadn't wandered a bit off the beaten track.\",\n",

They are tucked into a little neighborhood up the hill from the Freemont retail district. Seemed like a little hole in the wall. But you can tell they definitely have their local clientele. Whenever I've been there it is super quiet. It doesn't at all have the pulse of a place like Zoka in Greenlake. But I dig their coffee.

Also: no armies of wifi-crazed laptop users. No yuppies. Order a mezzo and sit outside in the sun and watch the dogs play and feel on top of the world.

This is yuppieville so I never sit in there.On the positive side though, this is one case where the beans are better than the coffee. Best beans I've ever had, fragrant and never over roasted, expensive too.

       " 'reviews': [\"This café's been around for quite some time and you can literally feel the love that goes into their coffee. Lighthouse understands the craft. I've gotten their lattes (both iced and hot) and both were amazing with well-rounded espresso. If you can, bring your dog! They have dog biscuits at the ready :)\",\n",
       "  \"These guys deserve five stars and here's why. First off this is a review not of a drink, barista or cafe. I ordered five pounds of lighthouse and I was excited to try it out. Now, Lighthouse roasts darker than most third wave roasters and frankly I didn't know this. I was in the mood to try something new and I had heard good things so I decided to give them a shot. (No pun intended). When I opened the bag the beans were surprisingly dark with visible oils. I was instantly disappointed because I prefer a lighter roasted coffee. Again, nothing against Lighthouse as their roasting style is probably right up the alley of most coffee drinkers. I reached out to them by email and within a day or so they had refunded my purchase and sent me a pound of a different coffee to try. This is the ultimate in customer service. I was frankly taken aback. Even if their roasting style isn't my preference doesn't mean you won't love it so please give them a try. They are local, small and have the customer service game nailed.\",\n",
       "  'Lighthouse is simply the best. My roommates and I come here multiple times a week for coffee and baked goods. They are also super dog friendly and have an adorable outdoor seating area! They will give your pup a treat with your permission.',\n",
       "  \"Picked up a bag of original and their featured blend yesterday as well and it's very good!The original has a very smooth finish and is super light unlike some of the ones were used too! I really loved how Le Coin which right down the cross promoted Lighthouse! Love seeing local businesses support one another! Especially during these times. I didn't find it very strong in the French press style. However I've had their drip before (first Seattle roaster I ever tried actually). And it's very good. So after brunch I popped up the hill to snag a couple of bags for the delonghi espresso I have at home. Had a cup this morning and it was very good! Grab a bag if you're in the area\",\n",
       "  \"1000% would recommend this place. I got a latte and and iced latte, both were so delicious and everything I would want out of a latte. The staff was friendly, the service was prompt and there's a cute little outdoor seating area.\",\n",

Great service and well made coffee. To test them, I purchased whole beans decaf. The beans were fresh, smooth, and delicious. If they can hit it out of the park on decaf they deserve more than five stars!\",\n",
       "  \"This is the best coffee shop/roaster in Seattle. Unlike Lighthouse's neighbors, Cafe Vita and Vif, their cold brew doesn't give you borderline cardiac arrest. At the same time, it doesn't lose its classic Lighthouse flavor. Smooth with every sip. No headaches.I am a drip coffee guy. Not one for an americano or espresso shot. But that changes at Lighthouse. Their espresso is elite, far superior from the rest. Excellent, knowledgeable staff. Worth the drive from anywhere in Seattle.\",\n",

       "  \"Lighthouse is, in many ways, the perfect classic Seattle coffeeshop. They roast in-house and sell and brew some of the best beans in the city. There's no wifi, so you have to hang out and read a book or newspaper, or talk to someone in the interesting crowd of regulars. Typically they have some delicious baked goods including cardamom cake and lemon glazed scones. However lately there seems to have been an interruption in this supply and they are offering more basic grocery store muffins. As a possible working location, it could be very good so long as you don't need wifi. I often find that I am more focused when working without internet access. If you really did need it you could hot spot or use your own internet of some variety. Currently, you can't sit inside, but rather order at the front door. There is a great outdoor area next-door for you to be able to sit outside on rocks or tables.\",\n",

These are supposed to be a fruit forward coffee, more acidity, it should be a light roast. The yirgicheffe beans I actually received were over roasted, with that tell tale glossy oil sheen.

       "  'Cute coffee shop that I only visited during Covid for the first time after moving to the area. There is always a line of at least 3 people, rain or shine, speaking to how popular this place is. Their lattes are really excellent and the texture of the foam is perfect. I love the donuts that they stock as well... Definitely a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. Love their roasted beans!',\n",

I found Lighthouse early last summer, and since then, these are the only beans I want to use for brewing! I like florals in my coffee, so I always get the Ethiopia beans. They're beautiful. I also love to make pour-overs for my coffee snob friends when they come over, and snobs are snobs, they know what they like. I often don't like that much what my friends make for me. But with the Lighthouse Ethiopia beans, I get complimented every time.Lighthouse is buried in a neighborhood, so it doesn't usually get that crowded.

There\\'s a small seating area to the side of it to enjoy your coffee outside if the weather is nice. The gal at the counter was pleasant. My low rating is purely based on my flavor preferences in coffee- lighthouse ONLY offers dark roast beans, and their espresso is only ever the \"roasters choice\" (which is the name of the roast, not the actual random choice of the person roasting) they do offer multiple blends of beans, which I did not sample, but are all dark/Italian roast. They could be good, and if you are a dark roast fan then this place could be your jam, but I personally did not care for their flavor profile.',\n",

The coffee was so delicious and was a wonderful surprise-the server told me it where to find it and off I went. The coffee shop sits slightly above the downtown Fremont area and parking is hit or miss. Loved the coffee, not so much the staff. The older gentleman behind the counter seemed irritated being there and wasnt very helpful with our questions. Nonetheless, coffee was my priority and I got what I needed. Minimal seating options with limited options for food.\",\n",

Down here in Texas, it\\'s my little piece of PNW heaven in a cup! Customer service is absolutely impeccable, and coffee is high quality, roasted with love you can taste in every cup.

This place isn't super cute or appealing to the eye (drab is the word that comes to mind but I feel harsh saying it). My wife loved her coffee but wasn't keen on sticking around for a while. However, if I was just getting coffee or had no focus on the decor then this would be my place to get good coffee.\",\n",
       "  'Lighthouse is a must-visit coffee shop for all Seattle coffee enthusiasts since this establishment roasts their own coffee in a quaint old corner building tucked off the beaten path up in Northern Fremont. While Lighthouse does offer top-notch coffee, this place does not tick off every box for the quintessential coffee shop experience, which is understandable considering the small size of this independent roaster. This location does have a cozy atmosphere, but there is unfortunately not quite enough seating so expect to get close to your fellow patrons. And even though the coffee is really good as stated, they, unfortunately, do not offer their coffee in pour-over format (only drip) and their macchiatos are served on their own with no accompanying soda water. This sounds snobby - and I admit it is - but I estimate that I have visited 200+ Seattle coffee shops at this point and I have grown to appreciate the finer details of my coffee experience.',\n",
       "  'Coffee is good - mellow and fresh. Pastries are yummy. I WANT to love this neighborhood coffee shop more than I do, but the service seems to me to be a little robotic. I get it - you have *lots* of customers, but a smile and a \"hi\" go a long way. Also, it\\'d be awesome if you ask me if I want a jacket for my extremely hot cup, because I\\'ll forget! And then I\\'ll be cussing to myself 15 seconds later as I walk home with a too-hot cup bouncing between hands. Thanks!',\n",
       "  \"I'm a huge fan of the coffee at lighthouse, and they make my favorite americano in Seattle, hands-down. For this reason, I will always be back.The shop itself is no-frills in a good way. Very neighborhood-y. I also love to lounge on the bench with my dog or hang out in the outdoor alcove. I like the owner and the employees, they are never too busy to chat with you. Wonderful humans!The pastries and nibbles here could use an upgrade. Except for the tiny cupcakes, those are incredible! If they got some gourmet pastries in this coffeehouse, it would be a bonus, but the coffee is the point so I can't say that I care all that much...\",\n",
       "  \"I really enjoyed this little corner cafe in Fremont. It was a nice, interesting little place. Their selection of drinks is ok, but not all that great. To be honest, they could have a much better selection of cold beverages such as sodas, etc. for people that want to visit but are not necessarily coffee drinkers. The atmosphere was great. It definitely had that corner coffee shop feel to it, which was nice. They roast the coffee there on site with the big machine out where everyone can see it and how it's done. It is really cool and an awesome thing to see with all the bags of coffee piled up. I like that they roast their coffee on site. They could have had a larger selection of food options too. For a coffee shop, the selection was very slim and not really anything that was all that appeasing. Overall, great place and cool practices! Just needs more options on the menu for drinks and food, maybe some more cold options for drinks and warm options for food. I definitely recommend for a local chill out/ hang out spot, place to meet friends if your in the area or a quick caffeine fix pick me up. :)\",\n",
       "  'Great local coffee shop. Seemed as though the owners were making the drinks themselves. My dad, who is a self proclaimed coffee connoisseur, was a big fan of his cup of drip. Seemed very fresh because the roast in house. They also have honey available to add on your own. Would recommend!',\n",
       "  \"Honestly this place was very disappointing. Everything about it was bleh. I came to Seattle for my honeymoon and was trying out about 3 coffee shops a day and was in the area and saw this one had great reviews. I also really like the location and the building, it's really unique and fits in very well with the neighborhood. Below are the reasons why this deserves a 1 star:Inside: As soon as my wife and I stepped inside, it was as if our nostrils were smacked with a fish... The strangest part is that there was zero evidence of the presence of fish inside. I don't know what that was but it was not very pleasant and we were trying to get out of there sooner than we could. Very unappetizing for anywhere but a fish market.Service: The barista that took our order really needs to put a damn smile on his face and take some personality classes. He wasn't the most pleasant individual at all. Maybe it was the fish smell getting to him? Who knows. All I know is he was one of the worst baristas I have personally experienced. Not in the snobby hipster kind of way. Just the unfriendly, I don't really want to serve you but I have to, kind of attitude. It was the older gentleman with the multiple ear piercings. I don't mean to call you out but come on dude. If you aren't goingnto have a positive and friendly attitude behind the counter of a coffee shop, get a new gig.Coffee: Got a latte all week I was in Seattle and this one wasn't that great. Too harsh for my taste even with the steamed milk. So on top of the fishy smell and lame attitude barista, even the coffee failed me... Thanks for the free sticker I guess...\",\n",
       "  \"I really enjoy their outdoor patio section. This is a great place to sit and relax. Hard to find places that are as chill as this place. It's always good coffee and always fast too.\",\n",
       "  \"Coffee: I always judge a place by their mocha. A+ on that!Service: Nothing stood out either way; the cashier and barista were fairly pleasant.The building seems large but it was busy (Sunday afternoon!) and occasionally very loud.

Based on the Lighthouse's lack of respect and consideration towards its neighbors, and the shamefully bold dismissal of my perfectly reasonable complaint, I cannot suggest supporting this business.If you are, or know these dog owners, please, leave the dog at home or address the barking. It doesn't do a dog any good to bring it only to chain it up alone outside just to bark its head off.\",\n",

I wrote down the Lighthouse Roasters name and I was finally able to check it out on a Friday after Thanksgiving. I called first to make sure they were open. Then I headed out to Fremont by bus and then walked through residential streets to get there. It was so chilly that day and I was really happy when I finally made it. Happy that I was in a warm interior, but disappointed as I expected to see a coffee shop and some retail setup where you can smell, touch and read about the coffee you are about to purchase. I remember going to Cafe Moto Roasters in San Diego which is located in a great industrial warehouse space with informative and passionate about coffee workers ready to give you tips and share their knowledge. This is not the case here: they only have a counter space where you can order coffee drinks and the coffee beans to purchase are showcased in a clear glass jars on the barista side. I was a little thrown off by that. Hopefully they mostly have it for display and don't sell these beans that are exposed to light and get to be sniffed around by people.  When I walked in there was only one person ahead of me and the barista was taking his sweet time chatting it up. I was a little in a hurry, but wanted to finally get their delicious tasting coffee and also some soy latte to go to warm me up. In the meantime about 4 or 5 new people came, but it was time to take my order. When I started asking about the coffee to purchase, the barista took down one of the big jars, but thought I would take forever, and he started taking order from the person behind me. I was really thrown off by that as I also wanted to order latte and now I would have to wait for him to finish his drink. I also walked really far and waited so long for this experience and this is not how this was going to happen. You can't always kill two birds with one stone. I just walked out. Possibly nobody meant to ignore me, they just got busy, but they should have the space organized better. For most of the time there was a woman behind the counter and she should have assisted some people. This place just makes no coffee love sense to me.\",\n",

The baristas are super friendly with very interesting shirts (think JFK riding a unicorn on the moon), and they got many comments by customers on their fashion sense! Also, it seems like they have a lot of regulars - they knew people by name on more than one occasion and remembered their drinks as well.The interior is very nice and cozy with lots of nice places to sit, and the coffee was great- very smooth. Pick up some coffee beans here for home. Pastry selection was fresh and good.',\n",
       "  \"Wonderful coffee shop with a great neighborhood feel. Their coffees have been a bit hit and miss for me. Sometimes really deep complex, roasty with hints of sweetness, other times just burnt and one-note. I think that they only really offer dark roasted coffees. While stalwarts of the dark roast have their place, the third wave of coffee has awakened customers' palates to other possibilities. I wish they would expand their offerings to some lighter roasts. Their banana bread rocks, though.\",\n",

       "  \"Lighthouse was really quaint and a place I could see myself working from easily for 8 hours. The lower rating is for a couple of reasons. First, I ordered drip coffee and wasn't sure if they had any different roasts or if it was just one. There was also no explanation for which coffee was on that day, and the one I had was a bit nutty, which I wasn't a huge fan of but still thought it was good. Second, I picked up the cup and noticed grounds floating in it, which I thought was weird because drip is supposed to be filtered. When I went to throw away the cup, I noticed a solidified mass of grounds at the bottom of the cup and was nervous that I had been given instant coffee, which I would never buy anywhere. I really wanted to like Lighthouse, but this wasn't a glowing endorsement. I'll try it again in a few months. Maybe this was a fluke?\",\n",

Besides the indoor space, there are several outdoor options to enjoy your treats-- the bench for people watching the bus stop across the street (also VERY convenient for those catching a bus or getting off)-- the chairs on the rain-protected west side, and the garden-y rock wall with even more seating and tables at the top!

       "  '*UPDATE BELOWAfter my stop at Cold Stone Creamery yesterday, it was off to the phabulous Phinney district to checkout Lighthouse Roasting and their much talked about coffee. Located in a turn of the 20th century (still sounds weird to me) building on the corners of N 43rd St and Phinney Ave. N, it seemed the perfect recycling of an old mom & pop grocery store. Walking up to it, I could just picture an old Divco milk truck from the Sunshine dairy or a Langendorf bakery truck parked in front of it for deliveries.Inside, I saw a few patrons, some with children, and the now typical toppers (laptop wielding folks). The innards of the place have by no means been updated to look like a designer coffee shop. No, it looks more like they put a roasting company and coffee bar in a small Moose Lodge. The staff were very nice when I ordered my double 12oz latte.Now, when it comes to coffee, I\\'m an awful popular fella (sarcasm) with baristas. My latte, from the bottom to the top of a 12oz cup is as follows: 1/2 inch of foam on the bottom (yes, before the shots)Two 20 second short pull or restretto shots poured over itSteamed milk poured slowly to the top150 degrees final temperatureThat\\'s a \"Phil\". I think it better blends the milk and shots together to make it taste more full and creamy. Some baristas have actually tried it and now that\\'s how they drink theirs. Try it that way sometime, you see what I mean. I didn\\'t have Lighthouse make a Phil. When trying a new coffee place, I judge how good they are by how they make a regular latte at full strenght. If they are good at a regular, they\\'ll be good at a Phil. My first Lighthouse latte had wonderful flavor if you like a little coffee in your milk. What I could taste of the coffee was respectably good. Not Peet\\'s nutty/cocao\\'y good but still good. If you like your latte leaning on the mild side, that may be a perfect latte for you but I like a little kick. I like to savor the flavor of good coffee. I realize that a latte is only as good as the coffee and the barista making it so in all fairness, they get 3 and a hidden half a star and I will try them again but next time, I\\'ll ask them give the shots a few more seconds on the clock.*THIS JUST IN: I needed some quick calories and was in the neighborhood of Trophy Cupcakes. yelp.com/biz/Bb-j-Kq81pF… They serve Lighthouse coffee there and so I ordered a hummingbird cupcake and a double latte and now it\\'s official, Lighthouse is delightful coffee when made correctly and is now my second favorite coffee.',\n",

Their bakery selection has a good variety, and just like their drinks, are just sweet enough.Their lattes are flavorful, but not too sweet. Their prices are reasonable, especially compared to their neighboring competitors. And their staff is friendly, to regulars and newcomers alike. I've read a few reviews stating their customer service could improve. Although there's always room for improvement in every thing, I never experienced anything less than great customer service at Lighthouse Roasters.Steal a seat outside and give yourself a little puppy play date in the morning, too! It's a win-win.\",\n",

I thought maybe there was a penalty for getting one of their cups, but I brought my own thermos and had the same result. That\\'s a 30% tax. $2.08 is still a reasonable price for espresso, yeah, but 30% tax? In what world do you live? Lest we forget Seattle is 9.5%. Other key fact, yeah, staff is not nice unless they deem you worthy. There is delay at every stage. Payment, when they actually start your drink and still more before you actually get your drink. They are always chatting with patrons who they like I guess, because their unspoken vibe is that everyone else can just go to hell. Coffee is good enough, prices are reasonable enough and if your personal shine is unaffected by the dark clouds that work there by all means go. I still will, but I\\'ll come out of it going \"really!?\" after every visit I\\'m sure.',\n",

It says an Americano is $1.60. What a deal! I order a 12-ounce Americano, and the barista tells me that\\'ll be $2.08. Uh, what? 48 cents tax on $1.60? Or just too lazy to update the chalkboard? And the barista couldn\\'t have given two craps about either of us. He took my money and went right back to chatting with the yapper dog\\'s owner, who scowled at me as I went over to pick up my coffee.(1) Don\\'t bring your dog in here if you see any dogs off leash inside the establishment, (2) Don\\'t trust the prices on the chalkboard, and (3) Don\\'t expect any kind of warmth from the employees or the regulars.

       "  'After a spending a beautiful sunny (and cold windy) day at the Zoo with the family we decided we wanted to warm up and take advantage of what Seattle has to offer before heading back to the East Side. Used my handy-dandy Yelp app and looks like Lighthouse Roasters is the place to be, there\\'s a Vita too, but I was in the mood for something different.Parking and Atmosphere: Anyway first off, parking in the neighborhood is meh, but gladly being a Sunday there wasn\\'t much traffic and parking nearby. Walking in, the atmosphere is really, well bleh. As others have said, the place feels more like it was made to be a Roaster and they serve coffee, versus being a coffee shop. There is seating, there is wifi, there are people hanging out. But yeah as others have said, it\\'s just not a comfy atmosphere, no music, the chairs are uncomfortable and wooden, most of the cups just don\\'t have that nice look/feel, and there isn\\'t much on the menu other than coffee. But since we were there for really a quick cup of coffee and possibly a bag of roast, I think it was fine. I was also able to find ONE kid\\'s book for my toddler. There is one plus for the atmosphere, which is the gigantic roaster. That my daughter kept pointing to and screaming \"TRAIN!!! Choo! Choo!!!\" mostly likely causing annoyance to those around me, but whatever It does indeed look like a train lol.The Coffee:  The wifey ordered a Mocha, I ordered a Cappuccino both in smalls. Oh and a chocolate milk for my daughter which the Barista happily made as a special order (much appreciated). Surprisingly there was not a size option for the Cappuccino, maybe due to lack of cup sizes? Anyway, both coffees were really good. Very flavorful coffee, and I really enjoyed the consistency of the foam for both. The coffee was so rich that despite both of us having a small, I was surprisingly very satisfied when I typically order larger sized coffees. Price: Fair, same as most other joints including the roasts which were about $14.50-$17/lb.Service:  The barista was friendly, I do appreciate that I did not get the unwelcome vibe when I brought in a toddler to this type of coffee joint, and he was more than happy to take the special order of a chocolate milk. The Roast:  I just had my roast this morning via pour over. 21 grams of the \"Roasters Choice\" with 360 grams of water. A very nice medium roast lacking the acidic taste you may get from other coffees and a little dryer. I enjoyed it very much and excited for when my wife gets home and we can share a Chemex this afternoon. Overall: Given I live in Bellevue, I probably will not be visiting that often, also given the atmosphere, not a place I\\'d hang out either. However, thank you for being inviting, the coffee was great. And I will definitely make this a stop whenever I visit the zoo for a bag of beans. Definitely worth a drop in if you want some great coffee and are in the area.Note: Someone brought in their dog with no issues. It was cute given the dog was very friendly and my daughter loved it. I can see how some people may have issues with non-service animals being allowed in a food establishment though.',\n",

The guy who roasts is a genuinely nice person, and will talk to you - or your out of town guests- while he is mixing beans or checking roast time. Lighthouse is all about the coffee - you'll find no mixed up goofy frapapapa whatever or pumpkin spice moomoo drinks here, nor is there any wireless (!) - which after a while I ended up liking because it makes you focus on the goodness of the coffee. There are displays of local art, and sweet kid & pet friendly seating with no sense of rush when enjoying your coffee and any conversation along the way. Go in the summer and sit outdoors in the lovely little stone garden on the side of the building, and watch the dog party congregate while their people go in for their morning libations. My only caveat: the drip is not so great - go for an Americano if you need your coffee watery...it's all about the pull here.

Over the years, I've had a series of really overstrong Americanos from this place because I wanted drip and they didn't, for whatever reason that day/week/month/year/decade/century, serve drip. When I wasn't in the mood for drip, I'd get a milk-based espresso drink of some variety and it would taste like latte-flavored water. The drip coffee I'm drinking (yay! drip!) right now from Lighthouse tastes like coffee-flavored water instead (boo! drip!).What gives? Is coffee -- especially drip coffee -- really so hard to do? I know I can be picky, but there is a huge gulf of coffee between the boundaries of good, black-as-my-heart black coffee and the point where you need a tongue-scraper immediately after consuming the beverage!It is a neat place, if sometimes unsettlingly loud and impossible to find parking for.

Get that double short Americano, add your poison (cream, sugar, or both) and launch into your first sip at the bar like a good Italian would. Ay, mamma mia, come perfetto! Two items of caution: the chai is dang spicy, and the iced mochas leave much to be desired. Everything else is dee-licious.

I guess he was too awesomely hipster to let customers know their coffee was up.  When we finally asked him about where our coffee was he said that those on the counter were ours. So why did he put vanilla sweetener in it then (which we certainly did not want)? Who knows. Strike three for me was putting the coffees into thin glass cups? Have these people ever heard of the principles of insulation and radiation, whereby lack of insulation makes your hand burn while holding the coffee and allows the warmth of your coffee to rapidly dissipate? This is why people use coffee mugs so their coffee does not get cold fast (as ours did) and you don't burn your hand. So despite this how was the coffee?

I would observe many warm, friendly interactions between the staff and folks in line or waiting at the counter and then my own interactions and those of some others were stony and rather curt. Since I have family that lives just a couple of blocks from Lighthouse and are there daily I had heard that it is a really \"local\" café and I\\'d read many Yelp reviews where folks had encountered the cold experience of not being a regular. Once, I\\'d actually sat outside for maybe ten minutes contemplating the choice of Lighthouse or Café Vita just a couple of blocks away and finally went to Café Vita just because of the desire to have a friendly interaction with a barista. In the months since that day I have come back many times and I must say that my interactions with the staff haven\\'t really changed all that much...I guess I\\'ve just accepted it. I\\'m not saying the interactions are bad, they just lack any of the friendliness that one would expect at a tiny, local café and especially when one can observe those types of interactions taking place regularly. With all that said, I think it should be clear that there must be a reason to come here: their cappuccino is, at times, the best in Seattle. It\\'s not always the best, the lack of 100% consistency is what I expect from any great, local coffee shop. But never bad, always good or better. I\\'ve tried their espresso before and I don\\'t recommend it. Zoka makes the best shots in Seattle - perfect without any added ingredients. Lighthouse espresso is not so good on its own, but really shines in a cappuccino. The baristas at Lighthouse care about making good drinks - not as much as some of the folks at Zoka, but they do care. Also, Lighthouse prices are on the lower end of averages in Seattle so I find them one of the better values. Finally, as far as the \\'neighborhood feel\\' of various coffee shops in Seattle, I have to admit that Lighthouse might take first place or at least rank very highly. They have a location that screams \\'local\\' and views that I find serene or city-connected (watching the Metro buses go by every ten minutes or so).

The espresso is on the bitter side in my opinion, not smooth like, say, Uptown's.  While Lighthouse is not an easy place to get to (especially by car- it can be difficult to park), I think the neighborhood regulars would like to keep it this way.

       "  \"This is the real deal for Seattle neighborhood coffee. Their beans are so good that many coffee shops just use their beans. But the atmosphere here is what you need to stop in for. I frequent this place and my other favorite (Herkimer's). A typical Saturday/Sunday morning here, locals may be huddled around a table jawing over a crossword puzzle, others just catching up. the place is always packed though never seems like much of a wait. And the coffee is up with the best (and that list does not include the lesser quality and highly commercialized better known brands).  I particularly like their Roaster's Choice if you want to bring some beans home with you.\",\n",
       "  \"Lighthouse is not only the best coffee place in Fremont it's the best in Seattle. I have NEVER had a bad coffee drink there. Normally I go for a flavor-less latte or just a cup of drip because most coffee places these days follow the awful Starbucks practice of masking crappy coffee with a lot of even crappier syrup. In the mood for a vanilla latte I took a stroll down to Lighthouse with my man one afternoon. I was so pleasantly surprised by the flavor of their coffee! The shots are always perfectly pulled and their milk is steamed to perfection.They are unpretentious and focus on making really good coffee. I've read some slightly unfavorable reviews of their pastries but I've always really enjoyed the baked goods the sell. I would recommend the pear tartlet if they have it! In the same vein of making delicious lattes, their mochas are the yummiest in the world. 2 years ago, when I moved to Seattle, I had sworn off mochas. Every place I've ever ordered a mocha at served something that tasted like steamed chocolate milk with drip coffee. Yuck. At the behest of my man I finally ordered one Lighthouse. As I mentioned they let their coffee speak for itself whether it's shots in your drink or just a cup of drip. They needn't mask any burnt or bad tasting shots. I don't know what syrup they use but it's delicious and understated; mild but existant. I'm sad I don't know his name but my FAVORITE barista in Seattle works at Lighthouse-he is tall and skinny with long red hair. Have him make your drink!\",\n",

       "  'Awful service. I have lived in Fremont most of my life and have been passing by the place since it was a little grocery store on the corner. I finally went in to check it out, and the unfriendly servers behind the counter helped the woman in line behind us as we were trying to order and then placed our coffee on the cluttered counter without letting us know. I would recommend walking the extra 4 blocks to Vita or better yet, go to Ladro on 36th. I am definitely never going back.',\n",
       "  \"Something about this place compelled me to stop, and boy am I glad I did, as I feel as though I've discovered a little, hidden treasure... They serve THE BEST Americanos here--I've never seen such beautiful crema on an Americano in my life! And, they are surprisingly--no refreshingly--inexpensive. I read a complaint that they are served in glasses, which is true some of time, but sometimes they serve it in a mug--and you can tell them which one you prefer--which is what I do. The prices on the wall are for single shots, which explains the discrepancy in the price--but who can complain about spending a little over 2 bucks for a high quality Americano with 2 shots, just because it is not delineated on the board? And, parking? Well, they are right smack in the middle of a neighborhood--the only parking is residential, but I've never had to park more than a block away (and it's free, at that). I guess there is a level of casualness in some of the details here, but that is part of what I love about this place (not something I appreciate everywhere) because there is something really relaxed about the vibe here that I am so in love with. It is welcoming, not trendy, but cool....and a culmination of things that just work for me (the greatest being their Americano)...and, again, I am so glad I just happened by it one day, as it could have easily been missed if I hadn't wandered a bit off the beaten track.\",\n",

They are tucked into a little neighborhood up the hill from the Freemont retail district. Seemed like a little hole in the wall. But you can tell they definitely have their local clientele. Whenever I've been there it is super quiet. It doesn't at all have the pulse of a place like Zoka in Greenlake. But I dig their coffee. I've had great results with the freshness and flavor of the beans I've purchased there. It is definitely worth a try.\",\n",

Also: no armies of wifi-crazed laptop users. No yuppies. Order a mezzo and sit outside in the sun and watch the dogs play and feel on top of the world.

This is yuppieville so I never sit in there.On the positive side though, this is one case where the beans are better than the coffee. Best beans I've ever had, fragrant and never over roasted, expensive too.
