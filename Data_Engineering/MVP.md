For this project I will be completing an end-to-end coffee shop recommendation model based on review text data.  Data will be scrapped from the web and brought into
a mongoDB before being vectorized and used for topic modeling.

The web scraper is working sucessfully for a single coffee shop and clicking though multiple pages of reviews, next will be expanding it to a multitude of coffee shops to ensure enough data can be collected for topic
modeling.
