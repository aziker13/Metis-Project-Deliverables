The purpose of this deep learning, multi-class classification model is to be able to identify a plant's species based on image data.
This model could help scientists help keep track of native plant populations in areas where they are low quantities, or to
track the spread of invasive species in sensitive ecological areas. Additionally, this model could be trained to help
plant enthusiest quickly identify plants at a store or in someone else's house they may be interested in purchasing.

The dataset comes from quantitative plant and is an image dataset containing 3300 images from 40 different species of plant.
An individual unit in this analysis is one image of a leaf with the image broken down into vectorized pixels. This model
will use the shape of the leaf to determine the species of plant. 

NN modeling will be done in python using keras with potentially cloud computing being need to run data.

A minimum viable product would be a binary classification system that categorizes plants into 2 different categories
