## New York Subway Turnstile Data Analysis 

The question I've looked to answer with this EDA project has been what subway station our clinet should be sending their survey teams to in order to maximize
their galaattendance.

I started with using data from the MTA website, and used the 13 weeks of most recent data (05/29/21 - 08/27/21) for this analysis.

Using this data, I created a bar graph displaying the stations with the 10 largest totals of entries for the stated Time period. Given the results from this plot,
Penn St station has seen the most traffic over this frame of time.

I decided to take a closer look at that particular station, to see if there was a particular day of
the week that sees more traffic than the others

This is a histogram, with each bin representing a day of the week, and the value on the y-axis being the mean entries for the corresponding day of the week 
at Penn St Station.  It appears that Wednesday has seen the most foot traffic on average during the summer of 2021.
