Dear Karrine and Dahlia,

Thank you for the email! We are very excited for the opportunity to work with you on utilizing MTA subway data to maximize
the number of signatures, donations, and attendees your field teams collect.  

I do have a couple ideas for using this information, and it centers around the indivdual stations around New York City. We will look to determine both the 
subway locations and time of day where your street teams would encounter the largest number of people who
are likely to donate and attend the gala.*At the minimum, We can analyze the MTA data to tell you which stations see the most foot traffic, as well
as those stations' peak hours so that we can maximize the number of encouters your survey teams has while in the field.  With those high traffic locations in mind,
we can look to further increase the likelihood of donations and gala attendence by pairing said stations with demographic data of the city, to try and increase
interactions with people who have the time and means to donate to WTWY international.  While we are making assumptions about the correlation between average income by neighborhood and willingness to donate, we feel as if polling potential attendees who would be able to make a larger donation makes sense for the goals of this project.

Much of this analysis will be done using SQL and Panda, while visual representation of our findings will be presented via matlibpro. Some visualizations will include the highest traffic areas, busiest times of day, and the intersections between busy stations and people with more means to donate.

Thank you again for the opportunity to assist you with your data analysis, and I look forward to sharing our progress.

Best,

Alika

*This is my MVP statement!
